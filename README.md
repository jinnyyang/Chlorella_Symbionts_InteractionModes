#### Information about this repository:
 - Original fastq files:
    - The raw data can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI under BioProject: PRJNA1266273.
 - Data:
    - Contain gene count table, EggNog and KEGG annotation output.
 - Database:
    - Contain files for matching COG annotation and DOM transporter.
      
 - R Script: Please notice the codebase is in the process of being organized and streamlined into the following 3 groups. Future updates will include a more concise and well-documented version...
  - A: Identifying DE genes and overall gene expression patterns.
  - B: Functional expression based on number of DE genes, Enrichment analysis using KEGG annotation.
  - C: Functional expression based on relative gene count using KEGG and COG (only focus on DOM transporters) annotation.
